# Java Program Overview

### Introduction
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language used for developing a wide range of applications. In this guide, we will explore various aspects of Java programming, including the compilation process, the sequence of execution, different types of statements, and how to write output-based programs.

### 1. **Compilation Process**

Java follows a two-stage compilation process:

#### 1.1 **Source Code (.java)**  
The first stage involves writing Java source code in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE). The file extension for Java source code files is `.java`. For example:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

#### 1.2 **Compilation (javac)**  
Once the source code is ready, it must be compiled into bytecode that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can understand. The `javac` compiler is used for this step.

To compile the source code:
```
javac HelloWorld.java
```

This produces a `.class` file (e.g., `HelloWorld.class`), which contains the bytecode.

#### 1.3 **Execution (java)**  
Finally, to run the program, you use the `java` command, specifying the class file (without the `.class` extension):
```
java HelloWorld
```

This will output:
```
Hello, World!
```

### 2. **Sequence of Execution**

In a Java program, execution begins at the `main` method. The `main` method is the entry point for every standalone Java application. Here's how it works:

#### 2.1 **Program Flow**
1. The JVM loads the class containing the `main` method.
2. The program execution starts from the `main` method.
3. Statements inside the `main` method are executed sequentially, from top to bottom.

Example:

```java
public class SequenceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Step 1: Starting program");
        System.out.println("Step 2: Performing some operation");
        System.out.println("Step 3: Ending program");
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Step 1: Starting program
Step 2: Performing some operation
Step 3: Ending program
```

### 3. **Types of Statements**

In Java, statements are the building blocks of the program and are executed sequentially. The main types of statements are:

#### 3.1 **Declaration Statements**
These are used to declare variables and methods.

Example:
```java
int number = 10;
```

#### 3.2 **Expression Statements**
These include mathematical operations, method calls, and assignments.

Example:
```java
number = number + 5;
```

#### 3.3 **Control Flow Statements**
These statements control the flow of execution within a program.

- **Conditional Statements** (if-else, switch)
  Example:
  ```java
  if (number > 10) {
      System.out.println("Number is greater than 10");
  } else {
      System.out.println("Number is less than or equal to 10");
  }
  ```

- **Loops** (for, while, do-while)
  Example:
  ```java
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      System.out.println("Loop iteration: " + i);
  }
  ```

#### 3.4 **Method Calls**
Methods are invoked to perform specific tasks.

Example:
```java
public static void greet() {
    System.out.println("Hello, User!");
}
```

### 4. **Output Based Programs**

Output is crucial in Java as it lets you display the results of your program to the user. The most common way to print output is by using `System.out.println()`.

#### 4.1 **Example 1: Basic Output**
```java
public class BasicOutput {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Welcome to Java Programming!");
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Welcome to Java Programming!
```

#### 4.2 **Example 2: Variables in Output**
You can combine variables with strings in the output.

```java
public class OutputWithVariables {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 25;
        String name = "John";
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Name: John
Age: 25
```

#### 4.3 **Example 3: Output with Control Flow**
You can also display output based on conditions.

```java
public class ConditionalOutput {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int score = 75;
        if (score >= 50) {
            System.out.println("You passed!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("You failed.");
        }
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
You passed!
```
